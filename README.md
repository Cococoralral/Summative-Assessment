Air quality in Europe studied and predicted with the latest data.

Overview
This repository contains the codes and data used to analyse air quality data from the World Air Quality Data 2024 (Update) dataset, with a focus on Europe. The analysis aims to provide insights into air pollution levels, their distribution and their impacts on different countries and regions in Europe.

Introduction
Air quality is an important environmental and public health issue, with pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), PM2.5 and ozone having a significant impact on human health and the environment. With increasing urbanisation and industrialisation, poor air quality has become a major global concern. Using the latest air quality data, this analysis investigates the levels, trends and impacts of pollutants using Europe as an example.

Data cleaning
The analysis starts with data cleaning, which includes identifying and processing missing values, removing duplicates, and filtering irrelevant data. Geographic coordinates are standardised and data are aggregated at a national level for visualisation and analysis.

Data visualisation
A variety of visualisation methods are used to explore and analyse data. Descriptive statistics provide pollutant levels by type and country. Geographic maps show the spatial distribution of pollutants across Europe, highlighting areas of concern. Bar charts and pie charts provide a detailed view of pollutant concentrations and their distribution in specific countries.

Analytical results
Key analytical findings include:
There are differences in pollutant levels between countries, with some countries having higher levels than others. And there are differences in pollution levels in different cities within countries.
Identify the countries with the highest and lowest average concentrations of each pollutant.
Pie charts to understand the main pollutants and polluted cities in Spain.
Geographic visualisation showing the spatial distribution of pollutants across Europe.

Conclusion
This analysis has provided valuable insights into air quality trends and patterns in Europe, highlighting areas of concern and opportunities for further investigation. By understanding the distribution and impacts of pollutants, policy makers and stakeholders can develop targeted strategies to mitigate air pollution and protect public health and the environment.
